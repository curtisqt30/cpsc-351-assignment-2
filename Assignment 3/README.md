C++

g++ main.cpp -o main
```

## Collaboration
We each collaborated on the whole file such as one person did the functions and one did the structs. We specifically did one of each and then got together at the end via a zoom meeting to discuss the program and see the changes we did. We were able to use version control like Git in order to make new branches as we worked on our code to prevent code duplication. Nothing special but we learned a lot on how to work with a team and unlock more skill!
